## [Lesson03](../readme.md) > Exercise03:

1. Open class [Main](../src/main/java/org/dii/oop/Main.java) in package `main.java.org.dii.oop` and edit the code to call run() method from `exercise03`.

2. Create a `MusicAlbum` class in `main.java.org.dii.oop.exercise03` package. Inside this class, create an attribute called `albumName` and an array called `songs` to store the song in an album.

3. Create three constructors in `MusicAlbum` to handle the following events. 
   1. when no argument is passed, `albumName` is set to `unknown`. 
   2. when only an album name is passed. 
   3. when an album name and the list of songs are passed. 

4. Use the keyword `this` to call the other constructor.

5. Create `displayInfo` method inside the `MusicAlbum` class to display the name of an album and its songs. 

6. Modify [Lesson](../src/main/java/org/dii/oop/exercise04/Lesson.java) in package `main.java.org.dii.oop.exercise04`. Create 5 albums and display the information.
